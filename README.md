Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Bilgin Ã–zkan, I am a visual designer & front-end developer from Istanbul. This is my personal website and  where I freely have a chance 
* to experiment with the latest (web) technologies, 
* to learn new libraries and
* to expand my Javascript skills.

## My goals

* [x] **Learn** GSAP - Core 
* [x] **Learn** GSAP - Draggable
* [x] **Experiment** SVG
* [x] **Experiment**  Dom API
* [ ] **Learn** Basic Git
* [ ] **Learn** Unit Testing
* [ ] **Learn** CSS Grid

## To run the website

The project is using NPM for dependency management and can be built using Webpack. The shortest way to start the website on your local machine is to build it with Webpack `npm run build` and run the website on webpack-dev-server with `npm start`

## Notes

This section is my notebook and it's constantly changing.

### Bugs, to-do list etc.
* [ ] **Main page** momentum.js ve scrollmagic.io yerine GSAP Draggable
* [ ] **Core** undefined ve null checkler iÃ§in tasarlanan helper'larÄ± kullanalÄ±m
* [ ] **Menu** Menu hover iÃ§in https://greensock.com/get-started-js: "Overwriting other tweens" baÅŸlÄ±ÄŸÄ± Ã¶nemli
* [ ] **Core** Fontobserver site yÃ¼klerken scroll ettiÄŸimizde bozuluyor sanÄ±rÄ±m
* [ ] **Gallery** Gallery'deki alt buttonlarÄ±n arasÄ±na bir Ã§izgi ve ok ile projenin gidiÅŸat yÃ¶nÃ¼nÃ¼n anlatabilirim
* [ ] **Gallery** Gallery'de touch draglar baÅŸladÄ±ÄŸÄ±nda yÃ¶nlerin isimleri Ã§Ä±kabilir guide
* [ ] **Video** /projects/skytankingovenon/gallery:1 Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: The play() request was interrupted by a call to pause(). https://goo.gl/LdLk22
* [ ] **Project** Background shapes on project.js#557
* [ ] **Core** TweenMax.ticker for resize and scroll events?

### Post processes
* [ ] CSS prefixes
* [ ] Documentation
* [ ] Polyfills: Promise, ...
* [ ] Cache-Control for images etc.

### Licencing issues
* [ ] Server & domain
* [ ] Vimeo Pro for background videos (! with `&amp;background=1` attr.)
* [ ] GSAP membership for throwsplugin (! don't forget to list others to be able to keep an eye on them)

### Extras and further (UX) improvements
* [ ] I think Mousewheel support is a must for everything from first page to the project slider. (! normalize-wheel)
* [ ] A jQuery like wrapper could be useful to wrap all the DOM related helpers. 
* [ ] Unit tests
