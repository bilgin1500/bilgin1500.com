## Intro
 
I'm Bilgin Özkan, a creative soul with a focus on web design and development. In the last couple of years I had the great opportunity to work for some of the best brands and products in Turkey such as Turkey’s largest bank Türkiye İş Bankası, Nike, Ikea, Turkey’s leading integrated entertainment company Pozitif and its venue Babylon, Turkey’s biggest publisher Hürriyet and Enka Culture and Art Center. Currently I am the Founding Partner and Digital Design Lead at [Rolakosta][1], a boutique design studio with a multidisciplinary approach specialized in branding, cultural projects and new media content.
 
## Projects 
Below you can find my selected projects.
 
### Rolio
A minimal Wordpress theme for the creative individual 
 
#### Problem
At [Rolakosta][1] a sizeable segment of our customers were individual artists, makers, writers and designers with a common need for a simple, ease to maintain and yet elegant website. After working with many of them we found ourselves repeating the same design process in every project and decided to find a better and easy way to serve their common problem.
 
#### Design
Altough these customers were not familiar with any of the content management tools available in the market, they had explicit opinions about how to structure and showcase their data. Thus, the content management tool we provide them with, should be easy to learn and flexible to fit their different needs. Hence, we decided to build a basic Wordpress theme using the Customize API, where we gave them the opportunity to manage their own data and change the look of their site in an easy and less time-consuming way. After sketching and designing the guide screens on Sketch, the process mostly went in the browser. I was responsible for both the front-end design and development and Wordpress theme development.
 
#### Results
Rolio is used for many of our customers ([burakozkan.info](http://www.burakozkan.info), [artwalkistanbul.com](http://www.artwalkistanbul.com), [utkudervent.com](http://www.utkudervent.com)) at [Rolakosta][1]. Rolio's vision in the near future is to make its way to Wordpress Theme Directory and gain some recognition and feedback on [GitHub][2]

### Beatsmap
Crafting a digital product
 
#### Problem
In Turkey the indie music scene is heating up and we, as music lovers living in Istanbul occasionally find ourselves trying to discover the newest bands from Bandcamp, follow the curators on Soundcloud or on Radio to catch up what's new and explore their events from Facebook or from street advertising. In this side project my goal is to create a digital product which is a hub for the local indie music scene and its event ecosystem.
 
#### Design
At the core of this project I simply wanted to gather the disorganized content and store it in one single database: an artist's basic info and his/her related social media accounts. I began the process by designing the data structure and database. Then I developed a web crawler with several spiders and data parsers capable of scraping pages like Facebook, Bandcamp, Twitter, MusicBrainz etc. The crawler - triggered by admins or as a scheduled task - scrapes the page, parses the data and saves it into MySQL. The API is based on GraphQL and designed to serve the data to all clients (currently admin panel and project website itself) with a great flexibility to evolve in time. For the visual aspect of the project I created a simple brand identity with a visual design system to guide me throughout the work and provide the product with the visual consistency it needs.
 
#### Results
This is a work in progress but the end product will be an intelligent system to regularly discover new local artists, collect their disorganized data (including audio samples and events), organize it and make it all available in a single website. Nevertheless I accomplished what I was aiming at first place: to become familiar with the latest web technologies like React, GraphQL and Apollo API and to design a visual system for a product.

### Skytanking Ovenon
Website design and development for Skytanking Ovenon
 
#### Problem
After being acquired by Hamburg based Skytanking Group, the Turkish Aviation Fuelling Company Ovenon, with its new name Skytanking Ovenon hired Rolakosta to design and develop their new corporate website. Our main goal was to merge the needs of Ovenon brand with their new global partner's vision and brand identity, while establishing Ovenon as the leading expert in the sector.
 
#### Design
After detailed briefing process by Ovenon's Lead Team, the design process began with the initial wireframing. After completing the architecture and the overall layout, we iterated through the visual design with a modular approach, where we built a variety of design choices for every module available on the page. The design process was finished in the browser by implementing the interaction layer including the animations and responsive layout. 
 
#### Results
The light and modern design of the website gained very positive feedback from the users and the companies involved in the process. Thanks to the user-friendly Wordpress panel we have integrated, website content is being kept very fresh with latest news, which strengthens its expert position in the sector.

### Şirin Pancaroğlu
Personal Website of Turkish Harpist Şirin Pancaroğlu
 
#### Problem
When Şirin Pancaroğlu, the internationally acclaimed Turkish harpist contacted Rolakosta her expectations from our team and from the current digital tools were clear: First, she wanted to be able to easily document every project she is involved in, with all the assets like photographs, audio files and texts. Secondly, she wanted to regularly reach her audience through newsletters and social media in a simple way, using a single panel without wasting time on technical complexity.
 
#### Design
At first, we spared some time to build the right information structure. Because of the complexity of our client's massive data it was a necessary process to be finished on paper, before any digital sketching or wireframing. With a minimal visual design and some basic interaction, we finished the design process and allocated most of our time to build the best administrative panel experience. After finalizing the information architecture, it became obvious that we should get some help from the great Advanced Custom Fields plugin to customize the panel according to our client's needs (e.g. related album information or flagging a content to be included in the next newsletter).
 
#### Results
Our primary objective has always been to equip the artist with the right tools to control her digital presence and do the basics of digital marketing in a simple way. Thus, in this project we created an interconnected system managed by a single Wordpress panel so that our client can easily organize her projects, manage the newsletters, post to her social media accounts and engage with her audience. Since its release in 2015 the website became a fine example for what an individual artist alone can achieve with its own data, appreciated and mentioned in various programs and articles.

### Capital Markets Department, Türkiye İş Bankası (Turkey’s Largest Bank)
Rebranding and digital product design for Capital Markets Department of Türkiye İş Bankası
 
#### Problem
Between 2015 and 2017 at Rolakosta we had the great chance to develop 2 big platforms for internal departments of Türkiye İş Bankası - Turkey's largest bank. One of these projects is the redesign and development of the intranet platform for their Capital Markets Department and the goal was to reach their employees with friendlier UX, raise the usage of the internal tools like Eurobond calculation and encourage people to read and share the valuable content they’re providing on their platforms.
 
#### Design
The project started with detailed user and data analysis. We found out that the content was hard to read and share, navigation was unfriendly and calculation tools were not working correctly. On top, the design was not attractive for the users. Based on these results we developed brand new visual style guides for these platforms with clear layouts, easy to read typography, colorful illustrations with warm color pallets. We also improved the navigation by developing tools such as search suggestions, document sub-navigation based on table of contents, user reading history and reading mode ability.
 
#### Results
Projects are being used at İş Bankası intranet platform and the tools we developed are serving all the employees on their daily routines. The style guides we developed are still used in both printed materials and digital products of these departments.

### Cappadox
Designing a digital festival experience 
 
#### About
From 2013 to 2016 at Rolakosta we had the great opportunity to work with [Pozitif](http://www.pozitif.com/) – Turkey’s leading integrated entertainment company in a great variety of digital products from their smallest festival microsites to their biggest flagship websites. In all these projects, we helped them build entertaining and colorful digital products to engage with their young and energetic audience. Me and my team at Rolakosta wireframed, prototyped, designed and developed websites, created motion graphics and gave consultancy services for more than 10 projects for 3 years we worked together.
 
#### Problem
For their new music and arts festival, held in the lunar landscape of Cappadocia in South-East Turkey we collaborated with Pozitif to design and develop festival's online presence. The main goal was to engage with festival audience in a different user experience reflecting the festival's mood and style by making the content exploration funny. Secondly we had to make 
 
#### Design
Having received the design assets from [Foxall](http://foxallstudio.com/) first we built a microsite to help the marketing team gather some information from early bird customers, using questionnaires and email subscriptions which eventually helped them shape the festival's program. Due to the short amount of time we worked close with our client and as they progressed with the festival content we simultaneously injected it in the ongoing design process and iterated constantly. The final website is a responsive single page application backed by the festival's data and authentication APIs and showcasing an experimental UX approach by embracing the drag, scroll and mouse wheel.
 
#### Results
The festival and its website with their unique styles attracted a lot of attention from the audience. In a short amount of time and little marketing effort hundreds of people attended the questionnaires and helped the team shape the festival. Nearly 90% of the festival's participants registered on the website, booked the events and made their programs. The mobile friendly website also helped the participants grab the latest news and announcements during the festival time.

### Babylon
Redesigning the face of a music and culture platform

#### About
Founded by Pozitif in 1999 to host the very best of progressive good music in the heart of Istanbul, Babylon transformed the city’s music scene and became a hub for international and local music culture. Its online platform, babylon.com.tr is the digital arts and culture platform that welcomes you to the vibrant world of Babylon where it offers music-centric news, exclusive content on Babylon artists and positive vibrations from across the globe with its distinct blog, festive radio and exciting event calendar.

#### Problem
In 2013 the Babylon team decided to redesign the digital outlook of the platform and revitalize it with a younger and vibrant identity. We teamed up with the internal development team to change the platform from the ground up with 3 sharp objectives: Take advantage of the new web technologies, be optimized for search engines and expand the content (with lots of new sections) while designing a better UX.

#### Design
Kalabalık bir içerik ekibi tarafından sık güncellenecek bu yeni platformda farklı kategorilere ait içeriklerin ilk bakışta ayrışabilmesi, bu içerikler ile ilgili tarih, yazar, ve fiyat gibi meta bilgilere hızlı ulaşılabilmesi ve tüm bu kalabalık içeriğin bir arada bir harmoni içerisinde durabilmesi için önem sırasına göre belirlenecek farklı boyutlardaki kutuları yerleştirebileceğimiz bir grid yapısı oluşturduk. Kutular bizim içeriklere açılan kapılarımız olarak konumlandılar ve her bir kutu içerisine de gerektiğinde gözükecek şekilde o içeriğe ait meta bilgileri gizledik. With countless iterations and Bu temel sistemi kullanarak ve bir yandan da geliştirerek platformun tüm gereksinimlerine çözüm üretecek tasarımlar geliştirdik. Yayın sonrası alınan başarılı sonuçların ardından yeni bir kararla radyo player ve kaynak bağımsız (Youtube, Vimeo, Soundcloud vb.) sitedeki tüm medya içeriğini oynatabilecek bir medya player'ın entegrasyonuna karar verilmişken ekonomik ve yönetimsel sorunlardan kaynaklı projenin geliştirilmesine ara verilmiştir. Bu süreç zarfında ortaya çıkan ama yarım kalan Versiyon 2 kod adlı çalışmaya da portfolyomda yer verilmiştir.

#### Results
Bir etkinlik takvimi sayfasından bir eğlence ve kültür platformuna dönüşen sitenin yenilenen yüzü ile öncelikle bounce rate oranları %80 bandından %55'lere kadar düştü ve zengin multimedya içeriği sayesinde kullanıcıların platformda geçirdikleri süre 3 katına kadar yükseldi. Kullanıcılar artık katıldıkları bir etkinliğin fotoğraflarından, Babylon TV'nin zengin video arşivine, müzik sahnesi ile ilgili haberlerden kapsamlı etkinlik takvimine birbiri ile bağlantılı tüm bu içeriğe tek bir çatı altından kolayca ulaşabiliyorlar.

### Kobe Takes Every Advantage
Launch of Nike Basketball Turkey’s Facebook page
 
#### Problem
While working as the Digital Creative Director at Grey Istanbul (2010 - 2012) / WPP Group, I had the great opportunity to work for Nike. The project we did for the launch of Nike Basketball Turkey’s Facebook page - with the help of Kobe Bryant’s Istanbul visit - differ from all other campaigns we developed in terms of the effort we and Nike’s marketing team put. Nike Turkey was planning to launch the official Nike Basketball Facebook page to be the hub of their total marketing communication. They decided to merge this launch with Kobe Bryant’s Istanbul visit so that they could engage all the basketball lovers and make them join their new Facebook page.
 
#### Design
The campaign was called “Kobe takes every advantage”. It was a great example of a holistic campaign (from event organization, to celebrity engagement and media usage) hold together by the digital platform we created. Together with Nike we planned a big basketball tournament called “Take the Court”, an after party and a tracking tool for Kobe’s visit where you can track him, watch the videos and ask questions, all LIVE! We designed and developed a complex Facebook App where players could build their teams and join the basketball tournament, follow the tournament results, track Kobe’s visit live on a map, watch him visit the Nike stores and basketball courts, watch him giving interviews at these stops and use Twitter to ask him questions.
 
#### Results
After a very successful launch (40k new users in one day) this Facebook App and its administration panel was also reapplied by Nike Greece team to support Kobe’s Athens visit. I was responsible for all the ideation, creative direction and interaction design of this project.

## More About Me
 
Thank you for scrolling this far. Let me try to introduce myself a little bit more by showing you some of my home-cooked tables, charts and gifs. If you'd like to contact me the answer is <bilgin1500@gmail.com>.
 
*Design Approach*
* Simplicity
* Responsive design
* Motion principles
* Illustration
* Approach: Design Systems and modular 

*Technical Skills*
* Javascript 
    * Why?: My primary programming language. I'am using JS from front-end to backend and loving its multi-paradigm nature where I as a self-thought developer can have the chance to learn different approaches like OOP or functional programming.
    * Libraries & frameworks: When not rushing to strict deadlines I am a vanilla JS dev who loves to harness the power of [micro libraries](http://microjs.com), powerful utilities and big frameworks when needed. I have experience in Backbone and React. 
    * Next gen: I love to study JS Design Patterns, learn next generation features as the language evolves (with using compilers like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)) and extend my knowledge on [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API).
    * Cross-browser compatibility: I frequently use [Can I Use](http://www.caniuse.com) database to support my target browsers.
    * APIs: When working on [RMP](/projects/rmp)'s crawler I studied and worked on various social media APIs like Facebook, Twitter, Google, Spotify and Musicbrainz thus I have a great knowledge how these RESTful APIs work. In [RMP](/projects/rmp) project I also developed an API driven architecture where all of my business logic and data layer is seperated from the clients using it. Using [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) in this project on the API layer significantly reduced my work load as I only developed one endpoint and one version of the API. 
    * Testing: Though being very new on test-driven development and unit testing practices I had the opportunity to use and practice [Nightmare.js](http://www.nightmarejs.org/), [Nightwatch.js](http://nightwatchjs.org/) and [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) in my side projects thus I am very capable of doing browser automations and tests.
* Server-side scripting
    * Background: In the early days of my programming career I first learned Classic ASP and even finished big [projects](http://isimetiketleri.com/ "One of them is isimetiketleri.com, an e-commerce website where people can customize and buy name labels.") using it. 
    * Now: Having choosed Wordpress as my primary content management tool I began to study PHP and now I have good working knowledge of it.
    * Future: I'm also working on my server-side Javascript capabilities and to know better the mechanisms of Node.js platform. While working on my side project [RMP](/projects/rmp) I used Node as my web platform and Express as my application framework. 
* HTML
    * Semantic
* Data
    * Mysql
    * GraphQL
    * knex, bookshelf
* Styling
    * Pre-processing CSS: Stylus
    * Post-processing CSS: Postcss, Autoprefixer
    * Web animations: GSAP
    * SVG: Svg.js

* Tools & Software
    * Code Editor: I am using Sublime Text 3 packed with [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting, [SublimeLinter](http://www.sublimelinter.com) for linting and [eslint](https://eslint.org) and [SFTP](https://wbond.net/sublime_packages/sftp) for file transfers.
    * Terminal: iTerm and Oh My Zsh
    * Design: As an old and pro Creative Suite user I used Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects and even Dreamweaver and Flash a lot in the past. Today they are still helping me with my raster works (Photoshop), animations (After Effects) or vector illustrations (Illustrator). But with the evolving 
    * Dependency Management: For now I use primarily npm for browser and server Javascript, tried [Bower](https://bower.io/) for front-end package management and loved it and I'm curious about [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and will test it soon.
    * Version control: Using [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) for now while working on my command line skills.
    * Automation: My build automation journey began with [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com) which I used as a task runner for almost every project. When I was learning React I met with [Webpack](http://webpack.js.org) and its approach to asset management which suited better than a task manager to all of my JS heavy web applications.

*Other than that*
* Open-source
* Role playing and Pathfinder (Storytelling, Game system)
* Comics (Drawing, )
* Cinema Arthouse (Film culture, )

## Sketchbook
 
Besides working hard for clients and personal projects, as a multidisciplinary designer I also find myself experimenting with new stuff which sometimes also deserves a mention. This is the place dedicated to them.
