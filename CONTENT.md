## Intro

Hi there! I'm Bilgin Özkan, a creative soul with a main focus on web design and development. Over the years I had the great opportunity to work for some of the best brands and products in Turkey such as Türkiye İş Bankası, Nike, Ikea, Babylon, Pozitif, Hürriyet and Enka Kültür Sanat. Currently I am partner and Digital Design Lead at [Rolakosta][1], a boutique design studio with a multidisciplinary approach specialized in branding, cultural projects and new media content.

## Projects 

Below you can find my selected projects.

### Rolio
A minimal Wordpress theme for the creative individual 

#### Problem
At [Rolakosta][1] we had a customer segment consisting of individual artists, makers, writers and designers with a common need for a simple, ease to maintain and yet elegant website. After working with many of these troubled souls we found ourselves repeating the same design process in every project and decided to find a better and easy way to serve their common problem.

#### Design
Altough these people are not familiar with any of the content management tools available in the market they have explicit opinions about their data, how to structure and showcase it. The content management tool we're going to provide them should be easy to learn and flexible to fit these individuals different needs. We decided to build a basic Wordpress theme using the Customize API where we can give them the opportunity to manage their own data and have the ability to change the look of their site in a easy and not that time consuming way. After sketching and designing the guide screens on Sketch the process mostly went in the browser. I was responsible for both the front-end design and development and Wordpress theme development.

#### Results
Rolio is used for many of our customers ([burakozkan.info](http://www.burakozkan.info), [artwalkistanbul.com](http://www.artwalkistanbul.com), [utkudervent.com](http://www.utkudervent.com)) at [Rolakosta][1]. Rolio's vision in the near future is to make its way to Wordpress Theme Directory and gain some recognition and feedback on [GitHub][2]

### Beatsmap
Crafting a digital product

#### Problem
In Turkey the indie music scene is heating up and we, as music lovers living in Istanbul occasionally find ourselves trying to discover the newest bands from Bandcamp, follow the curators on Soundcloud or on Radio to catch up what's new and explore their events from Facebook or from street advertisings. In this side project my goal is to create a digital product which is a hub for the local indie music scene and its event ecosystem.

#### Design
At the core of this project I simply wanted to gather the disorganized content and store it in one single database: an artist's basic info and its all related social media accounts. I believed that with all the social media accounts of an artist at hand we could gather more info about the artist whenever we wanted. I began the process by designing the data structure and the database and moved on by developing a web crawler with several spiders and data parsers capable of scraping pages like Facebook, Bandcamp, Twitter, MusicBrainz etc. The crawler - triggered by admins or as a scheduled task - scrapes the page, parses the data and saves it into MySQL. The API is based on GraphQL and designed to serve the data to all of the clients (currently admin panel and project website itself) with a great flexibility to evolve in time. For the visual aspect of the project I created a simple brand identity with a visual design system to guide me throughout the work and provide the product the visual consistency it needs.

#### Results
This is a work in progress but the end product will be an intelligent system to regularly discover new local artists, collect their disorganized data (including audio samples and events), organize it and make it all available in a single website. Nevertheless I accomplished what I was aiming at first place: to become familiar with the latest web technologies like React, GraphQL and Apollo API and to design a visual system for a product.

### Skytanking Ovenon
Website design and development for Skytanking Ovenon

#### Problem
After acquired by Hamburg based Skytanking Group, the Turkish Aviation Fuelling Company Ovenon, with its new name Skytanking Ovenon hired Rolakosta to design and develop their new corporate website. Our main goal was to merge the needs of Ovenon brand with their new global partner's vision and brand identity.

#### Design
After careful examination of the Skytanking website and detailed briefing process by Ovenon's lead team the design process began with the initial wireframing. After completed the architecture and the overall layout we iterated through the visual design with a modular approach where we've built variety of design choices for every module available on the page. The design process was finished in the browser by implementing the interaction layer including the animations and responsive layout. 

#### Results
The light and modern design of the website gained very positive feedback from the users and the companies involved in the process. Thanks to the user-friendly Wordpress panel we have integrated the website is getting more content updates than before which makes it more alive than its counterparts.

### Şirin Pancaroğlu
An interconnected system built for the individual artist

#### Problem
When Şirin Pancaroğlu, the internationally acclaimed Turkish harpist contacted Rolakosta she had a clear vision about what she should expect from us and from the current digital tools: First she wanted to be able to easily document every project she is involved with all the assets like photographs, audio files and texts. Second she wanted to be able to regularly reach her audience through newsletters and social media using only one panel and don't want to waste much of her valuable time with technical stuff and changing panels or web sites.

#### Design
At first we spared some time to build the right information structure. Because of the complexity of our client's massive data it was a necessary process to be finished on paper before beginning any digital sketching or wireframing. With a minimal visual design and some basic interaction we finished the design process and allocated most of our time to build the best administrative panel experience. After we've finalized the information architecture it became obvious that we should get some help from the great Advanced Custom Fields plugin in order to customize the panel according to our client's needs such as related album information or flag a content to be included in the next newsletter.

#### Results
At Rolakosta we always believed that the individual artist should take the control of her digital presence and be able to do the basics of digital marketing without any hustle or pain. In this project we created an interconnected system managed by a single Wordpress panel so that our client can easily organize her projects, manage the newsletters, post to her social media accounts and engage with her audience. Since its release in 2015 the website became a fine example for what an individual artist alone can achieve with its own data, appreciated and mentioned in various programs and articles.

### Capital Markets Department, Türkiye İş Bankası
Rebranding and digital product design for Capital Markets Department of Türkiye İş Bankası

#### Problem
Between 2015 and 2017 at Rolakosta we had the great chance to develop 2 big projects for internal departments of Türkiye İş Bankası which is one of Turkey's largest banks. One of these projects is the redesign and development of the intranet platform for their Capital Markets Department and the goal was to reach their employees with more friendly UX, raise the usage of the internal tools like eurobond calculation and encourage people to read and share the valuable content they’re providing on their platforms.

#### Design
The project started with detailed user and data analysis. We found out that the content was hard to read and share, navigation was unfriendly and calculation tools were not working correctly. On top, the design was not attractive for the users. Based on these results we developed brand new visual style guides for these platforms with clear layouts, easy to read typography, colorful illustrations with warm color pallets. We also improved the navigation by developing tools such as search suggestions, document sub-navigation based on table of contents, user reading history and reading mode ability.

#### Results
Projects are online at İş Bankası intranet platform and the tools we developed are serving all the employees on their daily routines. The style guides we developed are still used in both printed materials and digital products of these departments.

### Kobe Takes Every Advantage
Launch of Nike Basketball Turkey’s Facebook page

#### Problem
While working as the Digital Creative Director at Grey Istanbul (2010 - 2012) I had the great opportunity to work for Nike. But the project we did for the launch of Nike Basketball Turkey’s Facebook page - with the help of Kobe Bryant’s Istanbul visit - differ from all other campaigns we developed in terms of the effort we and Nike’s marketing team put. Nike Turkey was planning to launch the official Nike Basketball Facebook page to be the hub of their total marketing communication. They decided to merge this launch with Kobe Bryant’s Istanbul visit so that they could engage all the basketball lovers and make them join their new Facebook page.

#### Design
The campaign was called “Kobe takes every advantage”. It was a great example of a holistic campaign (from event organization, to celebrity engagement and media usage) hold together by the digital platform we created. Together with Nike we planned a big basketball tournament called “Take the Court”, an after party and a tracking tool for Kobe’s visit where you can track him, watch the videos and ask questions, all LIVE! We designed and developed a complex Facebook App where players could build their teams and join the basketball tournament, follow the tournament results, track Kobe’s visit live on a map, watch him visit the Nike stores and basketball courts, watch him giving interviews at these stops and use Twitter to ask him questions.

#### Results
After a very successful launch (40k new users in one day) this Facebook App and its administration panel was also reapplied by Nike Greece team to support Kobe’s Athens visit. I was responsible for all the ideation, creative direction and interaction design of this project.
