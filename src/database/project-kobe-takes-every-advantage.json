The project we did for the launch of Nike Basketball Turkey’s Facebook page - with the help of Kobe Bryant’s Istanbul visit - differ from all other campaigns we developed in terms of the effort we and Nike’s marketing team put. Nike Turkey was planning to launch the official Nike Basketball Facebook page to be the hub of their total marketing communication. They decided to merge this launch with Kobe Bryant’s Istanbul visit so that they could engage all the basketball lovers and make them join their new Facebook page."

          "text": "The campaign was called “Kobe takes every advantage”. It was a great example of a holistic campaign (from event organization to celebrity engagement and media usage) hold together by the digital platform we created. Together with Nike, we planned a big basketball tournament called “Take the Court”, an after party and a tracking tool for Kobe’s visit where you can track him, watch the videos and ask questions, all LIVE! We designed and developed a complex Facebook App where players could build their teams and join the basketball tournament, follow the tournament results, track Kobe’s visit live on a map, watch him visit the Nike stores and basketball courts, watch him giving interviews at these stops and use Twitter to ask him questions."
