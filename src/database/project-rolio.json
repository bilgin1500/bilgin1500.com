After working with many of them we found ourselves repeating the same design process in every project and decided to find a better and easy way to serve their common problem."

Thus, the content management tool we provide them with should be easy to learn and flexible to fit their different needs. Hence, we decided to build a basic Wordpress theme using the Customize API, where we gave them the opportunity to manage their own data and change the look of their site in an easy and less time-consuming way. After sketching and designing the guide screens on Sketch, the process mostly went in the browser. I was responsible for both the front-end design and development and Wordpress theme development."
